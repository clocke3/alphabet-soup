# Summary 
This repo holds a simple Javascript file and three text files for a coding assignment I was given optionally from a company interview. While I opted to do the other challenge, I wanted to try this one as well, as I wanted to try it in a different programming language than I usually use. 

# How To Run
1) Download repo files
2) In terminal, navigate to the `src` directory
3) Run `node crossword.js`
4) When prompted to enter a relative path, copy one of the three example text file names in the terminal and click Enter
